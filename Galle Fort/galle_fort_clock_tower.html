    identified as the tallest clock tower in the island.
    This was constructed in the year 1883 according to a plan made by an Engineer named John Henry Gues Landon in
    commemoration of the first Ceylonese who obtained the F.R.C.P medical degree from University of London
    (1822-1903). A great donor and Mudliar Mr. Samson De Abrew Rajapaksha who lived in Kosgoda donated the clock
    here.

<p> Earlier there was a belfry built with stones at this place that was removed in 1879 and the clock tower of a
    height 25.3 Meters was constructed. It overlooks the central moon Bastion which also happens to
    be the site of the old guard room. Constructed in 1883 it is a very popular landmark in Galle Fort.
    The tower stands four storeys high.</p>
