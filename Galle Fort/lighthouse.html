<p>Philippus Baldaeus, a Dutch minister who served in the area in the late 1650s, detailed his observations of Galle
    Harbour, in his work, Description of the East India, Malabar and Coromandel Coasts, stating that there was an
    iron cannon placed on the ramparts and a lantern to guide the sailors on top of the 28 feet above sea level rock
    which jutted out into the sea.

    The first lighthouse at Galle was built by the British in 1848.It was a 24.4-metre-high (80 ft) iron
    lighthouse, constructed from cast-iron plates, imported from England, designed by British architect
    Alexander Gordon and erected by Messrs. Robinson, Engineers of Pimlico.The lighthouse, painted white, was
    located on the southwest bastion, Utrtecht Bastion, of Galle fort on the western side of Galle Harbor. It had a
    fixed point light with prolate reflectors, which was visible for 19 kilometres (12 mi). In July 1936 it
    was destroyed by fire.


<p>
    The current 26.5-metre-high (87 ft) concrete lighthouse was erected about 100 metres (330 ft) from the original
    site in 1939. The original light was furnished with a glass prism lens floating in a bath of mercury (to
    reduce friction) and was powered by a weight driven machine.

    The light station is within the walls of the ancient Galle Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and well known
    tourist attraction. The lighthouse is strategically located at the southern end of the promontory, built
    approximately 6 metres (20 ft) above the road level on the ramparts, at what is known as the Point Utrecht
    Bastion, giving it full view of any ships entering Galle Harbour.</p>
