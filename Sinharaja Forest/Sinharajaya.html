        <p class="about">Sinharaja Rain Forest in Sri Lanka is probably the best kept secret in Asia – Sinharaja
            is one of the least disturbed and biologically unique lowland rain forests in Sri Lanka.
            <br><br>Sinharaja Forest Reserve is a national park and a biodiversity hotspot in Sri Lanka.
            It is of international significance and has been designated a Biosphere Reserve and World Heritage Site by
            UNESCO.
            <br><br>From Northern or western parts of the country you can reach Sinharaja Forest Reserve via Ratnapura,
            Kiriella, Kalawana, Weddala. From the South you can enter Sinharaja Rain Forest from Deniya. Coming form
            Hambantota, Udawalawe you can enter Sinharaja from Rakwana side.

                    Sinharaja is a vast forest which covers an area of approximately 11,000ha, is now a UNESCO World
                    Heritage Site. Located quite close to Ratnapura with approaches from other directions as well, this
                    dense
                    rain forest has an amazing variety of flora and fauna, and this has caught the attention of
                    scientists
                    as well as nature lovers who make excursions into the jungle to explore and appreciate its many
                    natural
                    wonders.
                    Among these are cool waterfalls, rushing streams and crystal clear freshwater streams. A lot of
                    attention and emphasis is now being placed on the conservation of this precious treasure that is
                    Sinharaja.
                    <br><br>
                    This rain forest covers an extent of about 11187 hectares from east to west of Sri Lanka. The length
                    of
                    the Rain forest is about 21km and width from North to South is about 3.7km. It was declared a
                    National
                    wilderness area
                    in 1988 and lately a world heritage site in 1989. It is situated in the southwest lowland wet zone
                    of
                    Sri Lanka in the districts of Ratnapura, Galle and Matara. The average annual temperature of
                    Sinharaja
                    is 23.6 C. Rainfall figures
                    show values ranging from 3,700 to 5,000 in and around the Sinharaja forest.

                <p class="flora-paragraph">
                    The vegetation of Sinharaja forest is evergreen forest type with a high degree of endemism. In fact
                    some
                    families show an endemism more than 90%.
                    The untapped genetic potential of Sinharaja flora is enormous. Average height of the trees varies
                    between
                    35m – 40m.some individuals rise even up
                    to 50m.
                    <br><br>
                    Out of the 211 woody trees so far identified within the reserve 139 (66%) are endemic. Similarly,
                    high
                    levels of endemism are perhaps true for the lower plants
                    like ferns, epiphytes as well. Out of 25 general endemic to Sri Lanka 13 are represented in
                    Sinharaja
                    forest.

            <p class="fauna-paragraph">
                Studies on the fauna of Sinharaja have revealed that there is a high degree of endemism among the
                butterflies, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals are greater
                than 50%.The most common deer species is the Sambhur, The Monk deer and Barking deer are also found
                within
                the reserve. Leopards are very seldom sighted, but their
                frequent presence has been confirmed by tracks and other signs.
                <br><br>
                Out of the birds recorded in the western sector of the reserve, 72% were resident non-endemic and 13%
                migrant. The rare endemic birds to be seen in Sinharaja are the
                Red-faced Malkoha, the Sri Lanka Blue Magpie, the Ashy-headed Barbbler, and the White - headed Starling
                and
                the Green – billed Coucal the rarest of Sri Lankan birds.
