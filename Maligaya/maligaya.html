      The Sacred Tooth Relic, which is housed at the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in the city of Kandy, is being
      considered and worshipped as the living Lord Buddha. For this very reason, there are daily, weekly and annual
      poojas and rituals. Dalada Perahera famously known as the Kandy Esala Perahera held in the month of Esala (July)
      annually is among them. It is considered as the epitome of country’s Buddhist celebrations and is blessed with
      divinity. According to Maha Parinibbana sutta of Deegha Chapter, among few other sacred relics, the four sacred
      tooth relics remained intact following Mahaparinirvana. Lord Buddha’s left canine tooth out of the four Tooth
      Relics which was blessed with Sri Saddhamma for 45 years was brought to Sri Lanka due to the continuous
      conflicts during the reign of King Mutaseewa in the kingdom of Kaalinga. Princess Hemamala and Prince Dantha
      brought the Tooth Relic to Sri Lanka during the reign of King Kithsirimewan, seeking protection for the Sacred
      Tooth Relic. This incident took place in 310 A.D.

      Following the arrival of the Sacred Tooth Relic, it was first housed in the Isurumuniya Temple and was honoured
      and worshipped with Dalada Perahera by King Kithsirimewan. It was so splendid that it left the King
      Kithsirimewan and the country men with amazement and awe. They made it an annual event performed in Anuradhapura
      kingdom with the anticipation of timely rain and good harvest. The background for the current street parading
      Dalada Perahera was set on those circumstances. No matter how the king was crowned, if he did not obtain the
      guardianship of the Sacred Tooth Relic, which has the miraculous power of giving timely rain and good harvest,
      in the eyes of the country men he was not regarded as the true leader with sovereignty.

      Sri Dalada Perahera, which continued to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic with numerous rituals and
      performances was held in the month of Esala (July) until the country was entirely colonized by the British in
      1815 A.D. Afterwards, it was permitted by the British colonizers, who made the country a kingless state, to
      perform Sri Dalada Perahera and the traditions relevant to the Sacred Tooth Relic continuously, with the custody
      of a Diyawadana Nilame (Chief Custodian).

      The tradition of Dalada Perahera, which was based on Buddhist respect and kindness, combined with rituals of
      Devala, prioritizing the ultimate humanity. The Kandy Esala Perahera Casket which is considered as living Lord
      Buddha which parades the streets is worshipped by the divinity, humanity and elephants. This is considered to be
      the oldest cultural event in the world and continues with its colourful,glamorous splendour making it an out of
      this world experience.

      The Sacred Relic of the tooth of Buddha (Buddh-dantya) is venerated in Sri Lanka as a relic of the founder of
      Buddhism.



      The relic in India

      According to Sri Lankan legends, when the Buddha died, his body was cremated in a sandalwood pyre at Kusinara in
      India and his left canine tooth was retrieved from the funeral pyre by Arahat Khema. Khema then gave it to King
      Brahmadatte for veneration. It became a royal possession in Brahmadatte's country and was kept in the city of
      Dantapuri (present day Puri in Orissa).



      A belief grew that whoever possessed the Sacred Tooth Relic had a divine right to rule that land. Wars were fought
      to take possession of the relic. 800 years after the Buddha's death, in the 4th century CE, the tooth came into
      the possession of King Guhaseeva of Kalinga, which roughly corresponds to the present day state of Orissa.



      Kalinga had become a Buddhist and begun to worship the Sacred Tooth relic. This caused discontent among some of
      the citizens, who went to King Paandu and said that King Guhaseeva had stopped believing in god and that he had
      started to worship a tooth.



      King Paandu decided to destroy the relic, and ordered to it brought to the city. It is said that, as the tooth
      arrived at the city, a miracle occurred, and King Paandu converted to Buddhism.



      When King Ksheeradara heard, he went with his army to attack Paandu in the city of Palalus. The invaders were
      defeated before reaching the city, and King Ksheeradara died.



      A prince from the city of Udeni who had become a Buddhist came to worship the sacred tooth. King Guhaseeva was
      pleased with him, and let him marry his daughter. The prince was known as Dantha and the princess as Hemamala.
      When they heard that King Ksheeradara had died in the war, his sons raised a large army to attack King Guhaseeva
      and destroy the relic. They entered the city, but King Guhaseeva secretly sent Dantha and Hemamala out of the
      city, with the relic.

      The relic in Sri Lanka



      The Temple of the Tooth Relic in Kandy, Sri Lanka



      The tooth sanctuary



      According to legend, Hemamali hid the relic in her hair ornament and the royal couple disguised themselves as
      Brahmins in order to avoid discovery. They set sail from Tamralipti, a port at the mouth of the river Ganges, and
      landed in Sri Lanka at the port of Lankapattana (now Ilankeiturei).



      It is said that Sri Lanka was chosen as the new home for the tooth relic because the Lord Buddha had declared that
      his religion would be safe in Sri Lanka for 2,500 years.



      At the time of Dantha's and Hemamali's arrival on the island, King Kirti Sri Megavanna or Kithsirimevan ruled Sri
      Lanka. The King was overjoyed when he heard the news and warmly welcomed the royal couple and received the Sacred
      Tooth Relic with great veneration. He built a beautiful palace within the Royal Palace Complex itself and
      enshrined the Relic in it. Thereafter, he ordered that an annual perahera be held in honour of the Sacred Relic.



      As time went on, as the land was threatened with foreign invasions, the seat of the kingdom was moved from
      Anuradhapura to Polonnaruwa, then to Dambadeniya and other cities. Upon each change of capital, a new palace was
      built to enshrine the Relic. Finally, it was brought to Kandy where it is at present, in the Sri Dalada Maligawa
      temple.
      The Sacred Tooth Relic came to be regarded as a symbolic representation of the living Buddha and it is on this
      basis that there grew up a series of offerings, rituals, and ceremonies. These are conducted under the supervision
      of the two Mahanayake Theros of Malwatte, Asgiriya Chapters, and Diyawadana Nilame of the Maligawa. These have a
      hierarchy of officials and temple functionaries to perform the services and rituals.





      Other tooth relics



      Aside from this specific tooth relic, another relic of the tooth of the Buddha is currently in Lingguang Temple in
      Badachu, Beijing, China.Fo Guang Shan monastery in Kaohsiung, Taiwan,the reliquary hall (shariden) of Engaku-ji in
      Kamakura, Japan,[4] and the Buddha Relic Tooth Temple in Chinatown, Singapore are all also reputed to each contain
      a tooth of the Buddha
